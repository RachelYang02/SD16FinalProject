Preparation and Framing Document

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
(picture in slides)



KEY QUESTIONS
	ROS:
We pivoted to using ROS--should we implement using audio with ROS? Can a ROS listener detect two things at once?
Distributed systemsâ€¦ something to pursue or DEATH WISH?




Graphics:
Should we simplify our graphics to keep it within the proper scope considering the two week timeline?
Numpy, arrays, efficiency? Worth it as a second step?
Mini Code Review Time!
Expected Behavior vs. Actual Behavior

AGENDA
	Remind audience about our project idea
	Ask questions and brainstorm solutions about ROS
	Ask questions and brainstorm solutions about graphics
Open up the floor; clarify confusing points; let them ask their own questions
